<h1> The Best of Baseball Awards - SQL Project</h1>
<p>Welcome! In this project, we will be looking at a massive baseball database containing information about players, teams, managers, salaries, and just about anything you might want to know about baseball. This dataset contains data from 2019 all the way back to 1871. Letâ€™s see what interesting facts we can learn from this database!</p>

<p>Project prepared in the form of a Powerpoint presentation.
  Here is the link to the live presentation: <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10f9l9PXFZRLU0CF70Urm-_-P7KNXN5bhMgYZY-M7xUs/mobilepresent?slide=id.p">LINK</a><br><br>
In the repository you will find an SQL file containing the queries I used, as well as a PowerPoint file and a PDF version of this presentation. I used the "Lahman Baseball Base" to prepare this project.<br>
