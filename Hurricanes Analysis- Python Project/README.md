<h1>Hurricanes Analysis using Python.</h1>

<p>In this project I wrote several functions that organize and manipulate data about Category 5 Hurricanes, 
the strongest hurricanes as rated by their wind speed. Each one of these functions use a number of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>parameters</li>
  <li>conditionals</li>
  <li>lists</li>
  <li>dictionaries</li>
  <li>string manipulation</li>
  <li>return statements</li>
</ul>
<p>Project is presented as a Jupyter Notebook file to easy read every function and show results. </p>
