<h1>Iowa Liquor Sales 2021-Power BI Dashboard</h1>
<p>In this project, I prepared an interactive dashboard to visualize the analysis of alcohol sales in Iowa for 2021. To create this dashboard, I used the Power BI tool and a dataset from official Iowa State website: <br>
<a href="https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy">link to full dataset </a><br>
I did not use the full dataset because it is too large (over 24m records, around 4GB). So I filtered only the data from 2021, then removed a few unnecessary columns and used the data prepared in this way to create the dashboard.
There is a PDF file (dashboard preview) and a Power BI file (.pbix) in the repository, unfortunately I was unable to publish it on the web and provide a link to it, because it requires Power BI Pro (paid license).
